# Using Weather Satellite and Ground Station Ultraviolet Light Data to Map Crohn’s Disease Hospitalizations: A 10-Year Study

Why this study?
THere is a seasonal variation in serum vitmain D level in Crohn's disease (CD) patients.
The major source of active vitamin D is metabolism via UVB light. Results from previous studies suggest an inverse relationship between exposure to UV light and C. difficile, diverticulitis and even surgical complications from CD.

Data sources:
National inpatient sample database
NOAA/NASA daily UV light data in the US collected by satellites and ground stations.  

Methods:
Looked back at each patient’s admission and matched it to cumulative 3-month UV light exposure 

Assumptions:
Patients had the same or very similar exposure to to the location where they are admitted
UVI exposure correlates with serum vitamin D


Data files:
NIS data 2001-2010 preselected for variables of interest on SAS.
UVI data
US zip code list

R Code files:
Commented R code provided in 7 steps
